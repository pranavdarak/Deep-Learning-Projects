# GRE Admission Probability Prediction using ANN

## ðŸŽ“ Overview

This project leverages an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the probability of admission to graduate programs based on GRE scores, undergraduate GPA, and other factors. 
The model provides a probabilistic estimate of admission chances, helping students to assess their profiles against the admission criteria of various institutions.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- Predicts admission probability based on GRE score, GPA, and other relevant features.
- Utilizes a robust ANN model for high accuracy predictions.
  
## ðŸ›  Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gre-admission-prediction.git
    cd gre-admission-prediction
    ```

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

The ANN model is structured as follows:
- **Input Layer**: Takes in GRE score, GPA, and other features.
- **Hidden Layers**: Two hidden layers with ReLU activation functions.
- **Output Layer**: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function to output the probability.
